# TransBorder Freight Data Analysis
This project analyzes transportation data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) to uncover insights into the **efficiency**, **safety**, and **environmental impact** of freight movement across U.S. borders.

# Tools Used
• Python (Pandas): For data cleaning, merging, wrangling, and analysis.
• Power BI: For visualizing trends, comparisons, and building an interactive dashboard.

# Process
This project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology which is a set of processes for solving data science problems. 

# Step 1- Business Problem Understanding
# Project Goal
To analyze freight transportation data to uncover inefficiencies, identify environmental impacts, and suggest ways to improve logistics performance.

# Business questions; 
1.Which transportation modes are the least cost-efficient?
2.Is U.S. export freight more cost-efficient than import freight?
3.Which U.S. states contribute the most to total freight weight and trade value?
4.Does containerization improve cost efficiency?
5.Are some ports handling low value cargo but incurring high costs?
6.What proportion of the total trade value is moved by each transportation mode?
7.Are there months where freight transportation is unusually expensive?
8.Is domestic trade more cost efficient?

# Step 2 - Data Understanding 
• Loaded the dataset from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.
• Combined Excel files per month, then merged all monthly files into one dataset per year.
• Combine yearly datasets into one final dataset for analysis.
• Reviewed the dataset documentation to understand column definitions and codes.
• Performed exploratory data analysis to Conducted initial exploratory analysis to:
•	Check number of rows and columns
•	Understand data types
•	Identify missing or duplicate values

# Step 3 - Data Preparation
• Loaded the dataset into Power BI.
•	Renamed ambiguous column headers  for better clarity.
•	Replaced coded values using the provided data dictionary.
•	Created new features: Cost per Kg and Value per Kg 


# Step 4 - Analysis

# Step 5 - Evaluation 

# Step 6 - Deployment
