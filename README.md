# TransBorder Freight Data Analysis
This project analyzes transportation data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) to uncover insights into the **efficiency**, **safety**, and **environmental impact** of freight movement across U.S. borders.

# Tools Used
• Python (Pandas): For data cleaning, merging, wrangling, and analysis.
• Power BI: For visualizing trends, comparisons, and building an interactive dashboard.

# Process
This project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology which is a set of processes for solving data science problems. 

# Step 1- Business Problem Understanding

# Step 2 - Data Understanding 
• Loaded the dataset from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.
• Combined Excel files per month, then merged all monthly files into one dataset per year.
• Combine yearly datasets into one final dataset for analysis.
• Reviewed the dataset documentation to understand column definitions and codes.
• Performed exploratory data analysis to Conducted initial exploratory analysis to:
	•	Check number of rows and columns
	•	Understand data types
	•	Identify missing or duplicate values
